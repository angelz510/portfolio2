          Originally from Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ and raised in the Bay Area. Enjoy building
          applications while learning new skills.
        </p>
        <br />
        Curious how technologies work and how they can create an impact in
        community.
        <p>
          Focus on creating thoughtful, functional, and intuitive applications.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        In the past, I've built applications using Node.js, React (and Redux),
        Django, MERN, Express.
        <p>
          Before development I worked in community, career coaching
          system-involved youth in San Francisco.

        <br />
        When I'm not coding I'm exploring Hyrule or home spraying my plants.
